## Apache Flink Connectors for Pravega

This wiki describes the connectors to read and write [Pravega](http://pravega.io/) streams with [Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org/) stream processing applications.

Build end-to-end stream processing pipelines that use Pravega as the stream storage and message bus, and Apache Flink for computation over the streams.   See the [Pravega Concepts](http://pravega.io/docs/pravega-concepts/) page for more information.

See the **Table of Contents** (right sidebar) for more documentation.

## System Requirements

**Java 8** or greater is required.

The connectors currently require Apache Flink version **1.4** or newer.
The latest release of these connectors are linked against Flink release *1.4.0*, which should be compatible with all Flink *1.4.x* versions.

## Releases
_At this time, the master branch links to Pravega as a source-based dependency with a specific commit-id._
